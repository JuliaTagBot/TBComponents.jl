# julia_microsim-

My first attempt at some microsimulaton stuff in Julia.

Will presently contain code for:

* poverty and inequality;
* budget constraints;
* weighting; and
* some general-purpose simulation components

A sketch of a Scottish tax-benefit model will follow when that's done, as a separate package
