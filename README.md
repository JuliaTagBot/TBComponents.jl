# TBComponents.jl

Some microsimulation stuff in Julia.

This contains code for:

* [generating standard poverty and inequality measures](docs/poverty_inequality.md);
* [generating exact piecewise-linear budget constraints](docs/piecewise_linear_generator.md);
* [reweighting a dataset so the weighted dataset meets a set of targets](docs/reweighter.md); and
* [some general-purpose taxation components](docs/taxcalcs.md).

There's lots to do. I'm new to this language and have based this code
on versions from other languages, so the code is likely not very idiomatic and
I'm sure could be made more efficient.

* fuller docs;
* better coding;
* more inequality measures: Palma, bits of decomposable indexes;
* understand generics better;
* ....
