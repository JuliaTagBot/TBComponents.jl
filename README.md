# TBComponents.jl

Some microsimulation stuff in Julia.

This contains code for:

* poverty and inequality;
* budget constraints;
* weighting; and
* some general-purpose taxation components

Lots to do, still:

* fuller docs;
* better coding;
* more inequality measures: Palma, bits of decomposable indexes;
* understand generics better;
* ....
